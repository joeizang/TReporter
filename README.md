# TReporter

Tripod Reporter is a small web application that I wrote to help family with insurance reporting. Its basically a demo 
application, proof of concept if you will. Will update it when we have a go ahead to do something permanent. Its also my first 
ASP.NET MVC development effort. I was really happy with it. Cheers!!1
